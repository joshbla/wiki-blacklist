This extension adds an event listener to the Chrome browser action, which is the icon that appears in the Chrome toolbar. When the user clicks the icon, the extension checks if the current URL matches the Wikipedia Random Article URL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random). If it does, the extension gets the current title of the active tab and checks if it contains any of the blacklisted terms. If the title contains a blacklisted term, the extension redirects the user to a new random article.

This is just a simple example to illustrate how the extension could work. You can modify the code to add more features or customize it to your liking.
