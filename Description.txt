This extension adds an event listener to the Chrome browser action, which is the icon that appears in the Chrome toolbar. When the user clicks the icon, the extension checks if the current URL matches the Wikipedia Random Article URL (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random). If it does, the extension gets the current title of the active tab and checks if it contains any of the blacklisted terms. If the title contains a blacklisted term, the extension redirects the user to a new random article.
The extension also uses the chrome.tabs.executeScript method to run some JavaScript code in the context of the active tab. This code retrieves the current title and body of the page, and concatenates them into a single string. The extension then checks if this string contains any of the blacklisted terms, and redirects the user to a new random article if it does.
